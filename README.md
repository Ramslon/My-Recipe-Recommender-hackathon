## üì¶ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/Ramslon/My-Recipe-Recommender-hackathon.git
   cd My-Recipe-Recommender-hackathon
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```powershell
   pip install flask flask-cors mysql-connector-python openai python-dotenv requests
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file in the project root:**

   MYSQL_HOST=localhost
   MYSQL_USER=root
   MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
   MYSQL_DATABASE=Recipe_DB
   FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_flask_secret
   ```

4. **Ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore`:**

   - Integrated registration and login forms.
   - Connected to Flask backend and MySQL for user management.

3. **Integrated OpenAI for AI suggestions:**  
   - Added `/suggest` endpoint in Flask.
   - Used OpenAI API to generate recipes based on user input.

4. **Enabled premium features:**

   - Managed premium status in the database.

5. **Improved UI/UX:**  
   - Added sample recipes, log-out button, and interactive footer.

6. **Secured secrets:**  
   - Moved all API keys and credentials to `.env`.
   - Added `.env` to `.gitignore`.
   - Cleaned git history using BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove secrets.

7. **Finalized for deployment:**  
   - Verified all features and security.
   - Pushed clean codebase to GitHub.

## üîí Security Notes

- **Never commit secrets:** All sensitive keys are stored in `.env` and excluded from git.
